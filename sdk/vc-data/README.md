# VC Data

> :warning: **WARNING:**
> Please be advised that the Affinidi SDK is deprecated and will no longer receive future updates. We have initiated this transition to streamline our development efforts and enhance the efficiency of our systems.

This repository contains the suggested specification for Verifiable Credential data, referred to as `credentialSubject` in the VC data model. In general, these schemas are based on [schema.org](https://schema.org) base types such as [Person](https://schema.org/Person) and [Organization](https://schema.org/Organization), with custom extensions for concepts not described by schema.org.

## Installation

```
npm install --save @affinidi/vc-data
