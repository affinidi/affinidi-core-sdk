# Affinity SDK for Node

> WARNING **Action required from you**  
> Update your services to use Affinidi SDK v6.0.4 or above.  
> Note please pay attention to the changelog while upgrading the version of SDK as some methods may be changed or deprecated.
> If you are using Affinidi SDK below v6, your application doesnâ€™t support Affinidi Vault and hence we cannot migrate you out of the Bloom Vault.  
> With Affinidi SDK v6.0.4 onwards, we have also introduced automatic trigger of migration to Affinidi Vault and that is why we ask you to upgrade to that version or above.  
> Otherwise your credentials will never be migrated. The migration will not anyhow impact SDK performance negatively.  
> Furthermore, if you have more than 100 credentials in Bloom Vault the performance should be increased after migration.
